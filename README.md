## Keyless SSL implementation in Go
Go Keyless is an implementation Cloudflare's [Keyless SSL](https://blog.cloudflare.com/keyless-ssl-the-nitty-gritty-technical-details/) Protocol in Go. It is provided as an upgrade to the previous [C implementation](https://github.com/cloudflare/keyless).

## Protocol
The Cloudflare Keyless SSL client communicates to the server via a binary
protocol over a mutually authenticated TLS 1.2 tunnel.  Messages are in binary
format and identified by a unique ID.

Messages consist of a fixed length header, and a variable length body.  The
body of the message consists of a sequence of items in TLV (tag, length,
value) messages.

All messages with major version 1 will conform to the following
format.  The minor version is currently set to 0 and is reserved for
communicating policy information.

Header:

    0 - - 1 - - 2 - - 3 - - 4 - - 5 - - 6 - - 7 - - 8
    | Maj | Min |   Length  |          ID           |
    |                      Body                     |
    |                      Body                     | <- 8 + Length

Item:

    0 - - 1 - - 2 - - 3 - - 4 - - 5 - - 6 - - 7 - - 8
    | Tag |   Length  |          Data               |
    |                      Data                     | <- 3 + Length

All numbers are in network byte order (big endian).

The following tag values are possible for items:

    0x01 - Certificate Digest,
    0x02 - Server Name Indication,
    0x03 - Client's IP address,
    0x11 - Opcode,
    0x12 - Payload,
    0x13 - CustomFuncName, (for use with opcode 0x24)

A requests contains a header and the following items:

    0x01 - length: 32 bytes, data: SHA256 of RSA modulus
    0x02 - length: variable, data: SNI string
    0x03 - length: 4 or 16 bytes, data: IPv4/6 address
    0x11 - length: 1, data: opcode describing operation
    0x12 - length: variable, data: payload to sign or encrypt

The following opcodes are supported in the opcode item:

    0x01 - operation: RSA decrypt payload 
    0x02 - operation: RSA sign MD5SHA1
    0x03 - operation: RSA sign SHA1
    0x04 - operation: RSA sign SHA224
    0x05 - operation: RSA sign SHA256
    0x06 - operation: RSA sign SHA384
    0x07 - operation: RSA sign SHA512
    0x08 - operation: RSA raw decrypt payload
    0x12 - operation: ECDSA sign MD5SHA1
    0x13 - operation: ECDSA sign SHA1
    0x14 - operation: ECDSA sign SHA224
    0x15 - operation: ECDSA sign SHA256
    0x16 - operation: ECDSA sign SHA384
    0x17 - operation: ECDSA sign SHA512
    0x23 - operation: RPC
    0x24 - operation: Custom Function
    0x35 - operation: RSASSA-PSS sign SHA256
    0x36 - operation: RSASSA-PSS sign SHA384
    0x36 - operation: RSASSA-PSS sign SHA512

Responses contain a header with a matching ID and only two items:

    0x11 - length: 1, data: opcode describing operation status
    0x12 - length: variable, data: payload response

The following opcodes are supported in the opcode item:

    0xF0 - operation: success, payload: modified payload
    0xFF - operation: RSA decrypt payload, payload: 

On an error, these are the possible 1-byte payloads:

    0x01 - cryptography failure
    0x02 - key not found - no matching certificate ID
    0x03 - read error - I/O read failure
    0x04 - version mismatch - unsupported version incorrect
    0x05 - bad opcode - use of unknown opcode in request
    0x06 - unexpected opcode - use of response opcode in request
    0x07 - format error - malformed message
    0x08 - internal error - memory or other internal error

Defines and further details of the protocol can be found in [kssl.h](https://github.com/cloudflare/keyless/blob/master/kssl.h)
from the C implementation.

## Key Management

The Keyless SSL server is a TLS server and therefore requires cryptographic
keys. All requests are mutually authenticated, so both the client and the
server need a TLS 1.2 compatible key pair. The client must present a client
certificate that can be verified against the CA that the keyless server is
configured to use.

The server will need a valid key and certificate pair in PEM format that the Cloudflare Keyless SSL clients will trust (the server will automatically generate the pair using the Cloudflare API). The following options are required and take a path to these files. These two parameters set up the certificate (and associated private key) that will be presented by the server when a client connects.

     --auth-cert
     --auth-key

In order for this server to authenticate the Cloudflare client's certificate, a custom CA file is required. This CA certificate is provided by Cloudflare and specified with:

    --cloudflare-ca-cert

The private keys that this server is able to use must be stored with a `.key` extension in either PEM or DER format, in one or more comma-separated directories denoted by the option:

    --private-key-dirs

Note that the configuration file is the recommended way to specify these options; see below for more information.

### Hardware Security Modules

Private keys can also be stored on a Hardware Security Module. Keyless can access such a key using a [PKCS #11 URI](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7512) in the configuration file. Here are some examples of URIs for keys stored on various HSM providers:

    - uri: pkcs11:token=SoftHSM2%20RSA%20Token;id=%03;slot-id=43989470?module-path=/usr/lib64/libsofthsm2.so&pin-value=1234
    - uri: pkcs11:token=accelerator;object=thaleskey;slot-id=492971157?module-path=/opt/nfast/toolkits/pkcs11/libcknfast.so
    - uri: pkcs11:token=YubiKey%20PIV;id=%00;slot-id=0?module-path=/usr/lib64/libykcs11.so&pin-value=123456&max-sessions=1
    - uri: pkcs11:token=SoftHSM2%20RSA%20Token;id=%03;slot-id=43989470?module-path=/usr/lib64/libsofthsm2.so&pin-value=1234
    - uri: pkcs11:token=elab2parN;id=%04;slot-id=0?module-path=/usr/lib/libCryptoki2_64.so&pin-value=crypto1

Note that for now only one PKCS #11 module can be used at a time, so if you have keys on multiple HSMs, we recommend using [p11-glue](https://p11-glue.github.io/p11-glue/) to consolidate access through one module.

# Deploying

## Installing

### Package Installation
Instructions for installing Go Keyless from `.deb` and `.rpm` packages can be found at [https://pkg.cloudflare.com](https://pkg.cloudflare.com/).

### Source Installation
Compiling Go Keyless requires Go 1.7. Binary distributions can be found at [golang.org/dl](https://golang.org/dl/).

Installing the appropriate package for your operating system should leave you with a [working Go installation](http://golang.org/doc/install) and a properly set `GOPATH`.

PKCS#11 support also requires cgo, which needs a working toolchain. Install the `build-essential` and `libltdl-dev` packages on debian, or their equivalents for your OS.

Then install the `gokeyless` binary:
```
$ go get -u github.com/cloudflare/gokeyless/...
$ go install github.com/cloudflare/gokeyless/cmd/gokeyless/...
```

## Running

The the keyserver for Keyless SSL consists of a single binary file, `gokeyless`. When you run the binary, it will first check for a `gokeyless.yaml` file in the current working directory, falling back to the system wide file located at `/etc/keyless/gokeyless.yaml` (the default configuration file will be placed there if you install via one of the `.deb` or `.rpm` packages).

You should add your Cloudflare account details to the configuration file, and optionally customize the location of the private key directory. Most users should not need to modify the remaining defaults.

Each option can optionally be overridden via environment variables or command-line arguments. Run `gokeyless -h` to see the full list of available options.

## Testing

Unit tests and benchmarks have been implemented for various parts of Go Keyless via `go test`. Most of the tests run out of the box, but some setup is necessary to run the HSM-related tests:

1. Follow https://wiki.opendnssec.org/display/SoftHSMDOCS/SoftHSM+Documentation+v2 to install SoftHSM2
1. Copy the test tokens to the location of your SoftHSM2 token directory (commonly `/var/lib/softhsm/tokens`, but may vary):

        $ cp -r tests/testdata/tokens/* /path/to/token/directory/

1. The tests currently assume the SoftHSM2 library will be installed at `/usr/local/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so`. If your system differs, you must create a symlink (sudo may be required):

        $ mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/softhsm
        $ ln -s /path/to/libsofthsm2.so /usr/local/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so

Then simply run `make test` to execute the test suite.

Note that if you need to run the tests without first configuring SoftHSM2 for some reason, you can use the `test-nohsm` target.
